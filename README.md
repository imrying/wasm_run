# Dart Wasm Interpreter

A Web Assembly executor for the Dart programming language.

Currently it uses the [`wasmtime 9.0`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) or [`wasmi 0.29`](https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi) Rust crates for parsing and executing WASM modules. Bindings are created using [`package:flutter_rust_bridge`](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge).

## Execute WASM on any platform

### Flutter

We provide [`package:wasm_run_flutter`](./packages/wasm_run_flutter/) to bundle the right binaries for your platform compilation targets.

#### Runtime for Platform

| Platform | Architecture               | Runtime<sup>[1]</sup> |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Linux    | aarch64 x86_64             | Wasmtime 9.0          |
| MacOS    | aarch64 x86_64             | Wasmtime 9.0          |
| Windows  | aarch64 x86_64             | Wasmtime 9.0          |
| iOS      | aarch64 x86_64 aarch64-sim | Wasmi 0.29            |
| Android  | armeabi-v7a x86 x86_64     | Wasmi 0.29            |
| Android  | arm64-v8a                  | Wasmtime 9.0          |
| Web      | N/A                        | Browser/Wasmi 0.29    |

- [1]: Wasmi 0.29 supports any platform that Rust could be compiled to.

### Pure Dart (CLI/Backend/Web)

For pure Dart application (backend or cli, for example), you may download the compiled dynamic libraries for each platform and specify the `ffi.DynamicLibrary` in the `setDynamicLibrary` function or execute the [script](./packages/wasm_run/bin/setup.dart) `dart run wasm_run:setup` to download the right library for your current platform and configure it so that you don't need to call `setDynamicLibrary` manually. The compiled libraries can be found in the [releases assets](https://github.com/juancastillo0/wasm_run/releases) of this repository.

For the web platform we provide the same interface but it uses the WASM runtime provided by the browser instead of the native library (you may also use the Wasmi WASM module // TODO: not implemented yet).

### WASM Web bindings

We use [package:wasm_interop](https://pub.dev/packages/wasm_interop) to implement the browser web API. We don't need to provide a custom runtime since the browser already has one.

However, in web browsers there is no support for the [WAT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) format and other queries that you may perform over the WASM modules on native platforms. For example, WASM [function type definitions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-types/blob/main/proposals/js-types/Overview.md) of arguments and results are not provided in most browsers. If you need these features, you may use the compiled WASM module (TODO: Not implemented yet).

We use the [wasm-feature-detect JavaScript library](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wasm-feature-detect) for feature detection in the browser. To use this functionality in Dart web applications you will need to add the following script to your html (not necessary for Flutter):

```html
<script src="./packages/wasm_run/assets/wasm-feature-detect.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="./packages/wasm_run/assets/browser_wasi_shim.js"></script>
```


## Parse Web Assembly Text Format (WAT)

Support for compiling modules in [WAT format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format). At the moment this is only supported in native platforms.

## Parse and Introspect WASM Modules

Parsing WASM and WAT modules to explore the exposed interface.

### Imports and Exports

You may retrieve the names and types of each import and export defined in a WASM module.


## Execute WASM Function in Worker Threads

Executes [function] with [argsLists] in parallel and returns the result.

The native implementation uses Rust's [rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/)
crate to execute tasks with a [work-stealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing)
scheduler. 

The web implementation uses web workers for running the functions an a simple task
queue for scheduling.

### Threads Example

The repository's [packages/rust_threads_example](./packages/rust_threads_example) directory contains an implementation example for a WASM module with shared memories, atomics, thread locals and simd. You may compile it with Rust's Cargo nightly toolchain:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory,+mutable-globals' \
  cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -Z build-std=std,panic_abort
```

The [threads_test.dart](./packages/wasm_run/example/lib/threads_test.dart) contains a benchmark and multiple usage and configuration examples.

### Web Workers configuration

The [assets/wasm.worker.js](packages/wasm_run/lib/assets/wasm.worker.js) is used as the script for implementing the worker, you may override it with the `workerScriptUrl` configuration in `WorkersConfig`.

Since functions cannot be passed to Web Workers, you will need provide the functions imported in the imported by using the `mapWorkerWasmImports` parameter. An example of the script can be found in [worker_map_imports.js](packages/wasm_run/example/test/worker_map_imports.js), it exposes a `mapWorkerWasmImports` that receives the imports, the wasm module and other information, and returns the mapped wasm imports object.


## Web Assembly System Interface (WASI)

We support [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) [wasi_snapshot_preview1](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/preview1/docs.md) through the [wasmtime_wasi](https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/9.0.0/wasmtime_wasi/) or [wasmi_wasi](https://docs.rs/wasmi_wasi/0.29.0/wasmi_wasi) Rust crates, [chosen depending on the target platform](#runtime-for-platform). 

In the web platform we do not automatically support modules with WASI imports. However, you may provide the imports manually. In the future we may provide an integration in a separate package, perhaps using [bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim](https://github.com/bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim).

### Examples

Usage within Dart can be found in the [main test](./packages/wasm_run/example/lib/main.dart).

The WASI module used to execute the test is compiled from the [`rust_wasi_example` Rust project](./packages/rust_wasi_example/src/lib.rs) within this repo.

You may compile it with the following commands inside the project's directory:

`cargo build --target wasm32-wasi`

or, if you have `cargo-wasi` installed:

`cargo wasi build`

### Stdio (stdin, stdout, stderr)

You may choose to inherit stdin, stdout and stderr from the current process. Or capture stdout and stderr to execute some custom logic for the stdio exposed by the execution of the specific WASI module.

### Directories

You may provide a list of directories that the WASI module is allowed to access.

### Environment and Arguments

You can pass custom environment variable and program arguments to the WASI module or inherit them from the current process.

### Clocks and Random

The WASI modules can have access to the system clock and randomness.
